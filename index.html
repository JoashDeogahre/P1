        <h1>Computer</h1>
        <p>
          A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
          Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
          These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.

        <h1>Car</h1>
        <p>
          A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
          Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.

        <h1>Smartphone</h1>
        <p>
          A smartphone is a mobile device that combines cellular and mobile computing functions into one unit.
          They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing[1] over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.
